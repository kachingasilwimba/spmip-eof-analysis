Data Overview

This document provides information about the subset of data utilized in this project, including its purpose, structure, and access instructions.

Purpose of the Data

The data subset is used to perform Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis on soil moisture simulations generated by the Community Land Model version 5 (CLM5). This analysis helps assess the influence of soil parameter settings on soil moisture variability across the contiguous United States (CONUS).

Data Structure

The dataset includes the following components:

- Soil Moisture Simulations: NetCDF files containing soil moisture data for various experimental configurations.
- Metadata: Information detailing the experimental setup, including soil parameter settings and simulation timeframes.

Accessing the Data

Due to the large size of the dataset, it is hosted externally. You can access the data through the following link:

Instructions:

1. Click on the link above to navigate to the Google Drive folder containing the data.
2. Download the files to your local machine.
3. Ensure that the directory structure remains intact to maintain the relative paths used in the analysis scripts.

Usage Notes

- Data Integrity: Verify the integrity of the downloaded files by checking their sizes and, if available, comparing checksums.
- Preprocessing: Before running the analysis, ensure that any necessary preprocessing steps, such as detrending or anomaly computation, are performed as required by your specific use case.
