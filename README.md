# spmip-eof-analysis

This repository provides tools for performing Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis on soil moisture data generated by the Community Land Model version 5 (CLM5). The focus is on assessing the influence of soil parameter settings on soil moisture variability across the contiguous United States (CONUS). EOF analysis is a statistical method used to identify dominant spatial and temporal patterns in data, making it particularly useful for understanding complex climate systems.

## Features

- **EOF Analysis**: Decompose soil moisture datasets to extract dominant modes of variability.
- **Data Reconstruction**: Reconstruct datasets by retaining significant EOF modes, aiding in noise reduction and data compression.
- **Visualization**: Generate plots to visualize EOF patterns and their corresponding time series.

## Installation

To use the tools provided in this repository, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kachingasilwimba/spmip-eof-analysis.git
```

Navigate to the repository directory:

```bash
cd spmip-eof-analysis
```

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. It's recommended to use a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Prepare Your Data**: Ensure your dataset is in a compatible format (e.g., NetCDF) and properly preprocessed (e.g., detrended, anomalies computed).

2. **Run EOF Analysis**: Use the provided scripts to perform EOF analysis on your dataset. For example:

   ```python
   from eof_analysis import EOFAnalysis

   # Load your data
   data = load_your_data_function()

   # Initialize EOF analysis
   eof = EOFAnalysis(data)

   # Compute EOFs
   eof.compute_eofs()

   # Retrieve results
   modes = eof.modes
   explained_variance = eof.explained_variance
   ```

3. **Visualize Results**: Utilize the plotting functions to visualize the EOF modes and their corresponding time series.

   ```python
   eof.plot_modes()
   eof.plot_time_series()
   ```

## Examples

For detailed examples and tutorials, refer to the `examples` directory in this repository. These examples demonstrate how to apply EOF analysis to soil moisture data and interpret the results.
